             <h1>About Natural Earth Healing Center</h1>
              <p>At Natural Earth Healing Center, we strive to do more than offer excellent therapeutic and medical massage therapy. It's our goal to provide a restorative experience that will stay with you. For the last two years, Natural Earth Healing Center has grown and become ever more successful only by word of mouth and the recommendations of doctors who have seen the benefits of our massage therapy in their patients. We meticulously screen each of our certified therapists to ensure they have the experience, skill, and knowledge to provide not just therapy, but healing. Our founders' history goes back nearly a decade when Mary Jo Nichols and Tonya Antl-Buck met. They had both found a career in traditional medicine and recognized a gap in care that could be met with massage therapy.</p>  

              <p>With training in a variety of specialties and modalities, our 10 massage therapists place their client's healing at the center of care by listening and establishing a relationship. We also work closely with physical therapists, chiropractors, and medical professionals to develop an individualized program that best meets your unique needs. With this more effective approach to taking care of our client's needs, we can help reduce reliance on medication while relieving pain from acute or chronic injuries. We also specialize in less conventional therapy including Phenomenal Touch, Cranial Sacral Therapy and Reiki. </p>

              <p>It's also important at Natural Earth Healing Center that the benefits of massage therapy remain with you, so we focus on providing the information you need to avoid discomfort and pain going forward. Explaining the importance of simple, but not always obvious, things like proper hydration and how to communicate with your medical professionals can make a big difference in your recovery and lasting comfort. We've found that the body can tell us so much if we just know how to listen and what to look for. Many of our clients have been recommended to us by doctors and physicians to help recover from automotive accidents. This partnership with traditional medicine continues to see us grow and help more people enjoy a more comfortable world. Word of mouth has allowed us to grow at Natural Earth Healing Center, which is why we have not advertised. This allows us to focus on our clients and develop individualized plans along with lasting relationships. We invite you to schedule an appointment online or give us a call at <a href="tel:(719) 632-5784"> (719) 632-5784 </a>. We are conveniently located at <strong>620 South Cascade Ave. #103, Colorado Springs, CO 80903.</strong></p>
