             <h1>About Natural Earth Healing Center</h1>
              <p>At Natural Earth Healing Center, we strive to do more than offer excellent therapeutic and medical massage therapy. It's our goal to provide a restorative experience that will stay with you. For the last two years, Natural Earth Healing Center has grown and become ever more successful only by word of mouth and the recommendations of doctors who have seen the benefits of our massage therapy in their patients. We meticulously screen each of our certified therapists to ensure they have the experience, skill, and knowledge to provide not just therapy, but healing. Our founders' history goes back nearly a decade when Mary Jo Nichols and Tonya Antl-Buck met. They had both found a career in traditional medicine and recognized a gap in care that could be met with massage therapy.</p>  

              <p>With training in a variety of specialties and modalities, our massage therapists place their client’s healing as the number one priority. This is done by creating an individualized treatment plan while listening and establishing a supportive professional relationship. We also work closely with physical therapists, chiropractors, and medical professionals to make sure your healing program and unique needs are being met. With this more effective approach to taking care of our client’s needs, we can help reduce reliance on medication while relieving pain from acute or chronic injuries. We also specialize in less conventional therapy including Lymphatic Massage Therapy, Cranial Sacral Therapy, Phenomenal Touch, and Reiki.</p>

              <p>Natural Earth Healing Center believes that the benefits of massage therapy can remain with you long after your treatments. We focus on providing the information you need to avoid discomfort and pain. Explaining the importance of proper hydration, stretching and how to communicate with your medical professionals can make a significant difference in your recovery. We’ve found that the body can tell us so much if we just know how to listen and what to look for. Many of our clients have been referred to us by physicians to help recover from surgery and automobile accidents. Our partnership with traditional medicine continues to enable us to grow and help more people enjoy a more healthy and pain free lifestyle. We invite you to schedule an appointment by calling at <a href="tel:(719) 632-5784">(719) 632-5784</a> . We are conveniently located at <strong>127 East Las Animas Street, Colorado Springs, CO 80903.</strong></p>
